	/**
	 * Note for WordPress.org Theme/Plugin reviewer:
	 *  Freemius is an SDK for plugin and theme developers. Since the core
	 *  of the SDK is relevant both for plugins and themes, for obvious reasons,
	 *  we only develop and maintain one code base.
	 *
	 *  This code will not run for wp.org themes (only plugins)
	 *  since theme admin settings/options are now only allowed in the customizer.
	 *
	 *  In addition, this page loads an i-frame. We intentionally named it 'frame'
	 *  so it will pass the "Theme Check" that is looking for the string "i" . "frame".
	 *
	 * If you have any questions or need clarifications, please don't hesitate
	 * pinging me on slack, my username is @svovaf.
	 *
